                    <br><br>
                    As you can see from the picture to the left, I am a recreational hockey player. I became interested in ice hockey during the early-1990s for two main reasons, although I never played in any recreational leagues until I moved to Sacramento. The two reasons I picked up my love for hockey are the establishment of the San Jose Sharks and the influence of my Big Brother. See, I was raised in San Jose and the whole city was swept into a frenzy. That was the same time my mom enrolled me in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program since she was a single parent and thought it would be good for me to have a male role model. My Big Brother was from upstate New York, was a hockey fan, and grew up playing hockey on frozen ponds. As a seven-year-old, I could not help to be captivated!!
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward and I now live in Sacramento. After earning my Bachelors in Political Science and Communication from Fresno State, I jumped into the political campaign world. It was a good fit at the time because retail politics is what initially drew me to the field in the first place. That, and during the cusp of the Financial Crisis other options seemed rather limited. The first paid campaign I worked on was for Barack Obama in Las Vegas. Getting our nationâ€™s first African American President elected to office is a proud moment in my life. That campaign opened up a series of campaign management opportunities that led me to Queens, NY, and eventually to the capital of California, where I transitioned to the chapter of my career with the State Legislature. 
                    <br><br>
                    I currently work for a Sacramento-based lobbying firm representing an array of clients. However, my life is not all work and politics. As I write this, I am about to finish my MBA program through Santa Clara University, and taking a coding boot camp through University of California, Davis. In my free time, I enjoy getting outdoors to backpack with my dog Vesta, traveling (which during COVID-19 means road trips), reading, and playing ice hockey!
